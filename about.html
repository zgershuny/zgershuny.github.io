      <h4 id="Early Interests">Early Interests</h4>
      <p>I've always been interested in computers. I did some basic coding in high school such as HTML and lego robotics.
        I had so many interests at the time, and the school did not offer opportunities to build on the skills I learned.
        In college, I was exhausted from studying AP Biology and did not want to pursue a degree in a science-related field
        even though I was always fascinated by technology and science. I loved and double majored in History and Government.</p>
      <h4 id="Sparks">Sparks</h4>
      <p>I did some internships for NYC elected officials and decided that I would prefer to work for the NYC government than
        at other levels because I thought I could have the most positive and direct impact because the issues are at the
        local level. Within a year I started working for a NYC agency, I was inspired by my senior supervisor to build my own
        computer. He built his and provided some advice. I renewed my interst in computers, especially about hardware since
        I did some tinkering as a child when I installed a graphics card and cleaned some fans. I thought about studying to
        get a COMPTIA+ certificate and start a career as a IT Technician in the IT Department, but I was not interested enough to find
        myself committed to the studies. Around this time, I started my Masters in Public Administration.</p>
      <h4 id="Fireworks">Fireworks</h4>
      <p>What really set off the fireworks was when I got into building circuits with kits and scratch from Adafruit. I tried to make
        a Gps Step Tracker for my parents' dog but the code did not work. It was in C, so I started to teach myself C from
        Harvard's CS50 on EDX.org. Never finished because of my studies and jumped over to MIT's Introductory class in Python.
        Some day, I'll finish that GPS step tracker!</p>
      <h4 id="Capstone">Capstone</h4>
      <p>At some point halfway through my master's program, I got a new position within my agency with increased responsibilities.
        My agency released a new system called DYCD Connect, and I became very interested in governments' websites and
        database systems. My capstone was about the people's experience using government websites and compare that to
        non profit and the private sector. I learned that I wanted to be more involved in the government's work to better
        its technological systems so that the quality of services are improved for the people.</p>
      <h4 id="OSU">OSU</h4>
      <p>I decided to enroll in OSU Computer Science program to assist me in developing required skills needed to achieve my
        career transition. I can bring my experience working as a Program Manager who experienced at the front level to understand
        what the systems should be doing and why to make it more friendly for everyone.</p>
      <h4 id="Data">Data</h4>
      <p>Then, with DYCD Connect, I became really interested in Data Science/Analytics. I developed questions, ran queries
        and reports, analyzed the data, created a data visualization on PowerPoint, and presented to an audience up to forty
        people.</p>
