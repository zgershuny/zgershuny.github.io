Zoe GershunyCS 290: Project Proposal2/10/2020The website is a personal website about my journey into the Computer Science field. It will have a home page that has a brief overview of the websiteâ€™s purpose and an automatic carousel of images from websites.There will be a horizontal menu (navbar) at the top of the homepage and all three subpages on the left side. On the right side are the Font Awesome icons to access to my Github and Linkedin pages and email me.The three subpages are About Me, Projects, and Contact. About is my path into the Computer Science field and what I hope to achieve. A downloadable resume will be included on this page. Projects is what I have worked on thus far and an unordered HTML list of resources I utilized to help me. Contact is where the form will be if a reader would like to contact me or subscribe to updates.I have yet to decide where the scroll box in one page will be.I will be using Bootstrap for this project and find ways to incorporate CSS. I have yet to figure out when to use JavaScript, probably with the form when I should use POST asynchronously (similar to Activity 5: Ajax Interactions).
